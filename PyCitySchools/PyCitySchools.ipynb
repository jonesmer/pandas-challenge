    "# PyCity Schools Analysis #\n",
    "\n",
    "### District Summary ###\n",
    "* Across the 15 schools in the district, the total budget is over 24 million dollars (an average of \\\\$629 per student).\n",
    "* The average math score across the district is 78.99, with __74.98%__ of students across the district passing.\n",
    "* The average reading score across the district is 81.88, with __85.81%__ of students across the district passing.\n",
    "* Overall, __65.1%__ of students passed both math and reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "### School Summary ###\n",
    "* Individual schools' budgets vary from **\\\\$578 to \\\\$655** per student. In general, the 7 charter schools in the district spent _less_ per student than the 8 district schools.\n",
    "* The average math score per school ranged from **76.6 to 83.8**. The average reading scores at each school were between **80.7 and 84.0**. The raw scores for both subjects are fairly evenly distributed around the district-wide average.\n",
    "* We see a wider range when looking at the passing rates - the percent passing math ranges from **65.7% to 94.6%**, while the reading percentages range from **79.3% to 97.3%**.\n",
    "* The rate of students passing both subjects range from **52.9% to 91.3%** among all schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highest- and Lowest-Performing Schools ###\n",
    "* The five schools with the highest overall passing rates are Cabrera HS, Thomas HS, Griffin HS, Wilson HS, and Pena HS. All five of these schools are _charter schools_, and all of them had over 90% of students passing both subjects.\n",
    "* The five schools with the lowest overall passing rates are Rodriguez HS, Figueroa HS, Huang HS, Hernandez HS, and Johnson HS. All five of these schools are _district schools_, with rates between 52% and 54% of students passing both subjects.\n",
    "* The average number of students in the top 5 performers is 1250 students. The average number of students in the bottom 5 performers is 4264 students.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scores by Grade ###\n",
    "* In both math and reading, the average scores per grade were fairly consistent with each school's averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Conclusions ###\n",
    "* When looking at the scores by school spending, the schools that spent less money per student actually did better than the higher-spending schools.\n",
    "* When looked at through the lens of school size, the small and medium schools (less than 2000 students) did significantly better than schools with over 2000 students.\n",
    "* There is also a significant difference between passing rates of Charter (90.4%) and District schools (53.7%).\n",
    "* The largest schools are district schools, and they also spend more per student. This either indicates a counter-intuitive relationship between spending per student and passing rates, or perhaps spending per student does not affect passing rates at all."
