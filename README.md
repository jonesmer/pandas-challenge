# Pandas Challenge #
Contained in this repository is an analysis exercise using a Jupyter notebook and pandas. It also contains CSVs of the data used in the analysis.

* The first cell of the notebook contains the analysis of the entire body of data.
* The cells below that are the calculations and dataframe manipulations used to execute the analysis.

* Things that could make the analysis better:
  * Knowing the student-to-teacher ratios of the schools.
  * Do charter schools receive funding from places that aren't accounted for in the data?

_The code used in this notebook is mostly mine. I was given some starter code with dependencies listed and a few tables manipulated, so some of the code was provided by edX. I received some help from the instructional staff for class, but it was for syntax errors, not a unique block of code. Google, python.org, and StackOverflow were used for other syntax questions I had while working through the solution. The entire analysis was written by me._
